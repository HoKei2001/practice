'''
Here you see an issue with defining a generic interface, like the payment processor, 
to do multiple things that are not always applicable to subclasses. 
In this case, not all subclasses support two-factor authentication, 
so itâ€™s better to create separate interfaces for this. 

For example, we could add a second subclass of payment processor that includes SMS two-factor authentication capabilities.
